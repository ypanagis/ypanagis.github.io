title: About this blog!

This blog is my personal blog that discusses all the data tales I embark on from time to time, in the hope that someone finds them useful and as a way for me to remember what I have done and since I am procrastinating too much to set up my own website with some CMS I decided to set up this wonderful blog with the aid of [Jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)
